Not the most glamorous,but it's long overdue

SO

new function: buttonloader
or something along those lines

there is a list
with a list of boolean values
and those values correspond to a button
and if true, that button is drawn
and if false, the button is not drawn

and its handled dynamically, such that the next button is drawn to the next available position

for example
let's say I have state[0] = {1, 1, 1, 0} and state[1] = {1, 1, 0, 1}

and so when I get to drawing the buttons, I go

button 0: new game-> drawn
button 1: check -> drawn
button 2: show solution -> drawn
button 3: hide solution -> not drawn

and it'd be way easier to create new states
since I'd just have to modify which state to call
and the states can be described independently/stored somewhere else

I've been thinking- if I end up working some more on Slitherlink, I might as well submit it to the Neumann contest as well, if it is polished somewhat

a tad different

pass a list of strings as argument
and then for each button check whether it's "name" is included, and if so, draw it
